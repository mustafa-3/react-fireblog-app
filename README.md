My purpose in making this project is to use the power of React Hooks on the page by using multiple methods. With Firebase Authentication, I restricted access to the page without user login.  With Firebase Realtime Database, i made it easy for users who want to visit the page, add a new blog or make changes on the added block. With the Context structure, it was possible to access the firebase functions from each component and I provided the page transitions with the routers. I used Material UI for styling and tried to pay attention to every detail to make the page responsive.
